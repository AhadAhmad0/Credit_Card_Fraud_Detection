# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection

📌 Project Overview:
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using Machine Learning techniques. The notebook Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb demonstrates the complete end-to-end workflow of a fraud detection system, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, evaluation, and performance comparison.

Credit card fraud detection is a highly imbalanced classification problem where fraudulent transactions represent a very small percentage of the dataset. This project applies appropriate techniques to handle class imbalance and improve prediction accuracy.

📊 Project Workflow:
1️⃣ Data Loading & Exploration:
1.Importing necessary Python libraries
2.Loading the dataset
2.Understanding features, target variable, and data distribution
4.Checking for missing values

2️⃣ Data Preprocessing:
1.Feature scaling (if required)
2.Handling class imbalance (e.g., undersampling/oversampling techniques like SMOTE)
3.Splitting dataset into training and testing sets

3️⃣ Model Building:
The notebook applies machine learning classification algorithms such as:
1.Logistic Regression
2.Decision Tree
3.Random Forest
Other ensemble or advanced models (if included)

4️⃣ Model Evaluation:
1.Accuracy Score
2.Precision, Recall, F1-Score
3.Confusion Matrix

📦 Required Libraries:
1.numpy
2.pandas
3.matplotlib
4.seaborn
5.scikit-learn
6.imbalanced-learn (for handling imbalanced datasets)
7.joblib (optional, for saving models)
8.ROC-AUC Score

Performance comparison helps identify the most effective model for fraud detection.

🎯 Conclusion:

This project demonstrates practical implementation of machine learning for financial fraud detection. It highlights the importance of handling imbalanced datasets and selecting appropriate evaluation metrics to build reliable fraud detection systems.
